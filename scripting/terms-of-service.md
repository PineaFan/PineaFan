## Terms & Conditions

### 1. Parties
**PineaFan** (“I”, “me”) provides custom JavaScript / XToys scripting services to **the Client** (“you”).

### 2. Scope & Specification
1. You supply a written specification, **or** I draft one from your notes and you approve it in writing (Discord or e-mail).  
2. The approved specification will not change; new requirements are treated as new work at the rates above.

### 3. Deliverables & Acceptance
1. I supply an unlisted YouTube link (or direct Discord video) demonstrating every feature.  
2. Once you confirm that the video meets the spec, I issue a PayPal invoice.  
3. When the invoice is paid, you receive the source code and a README within **3 UK working days** (usually sooner).

### 4. Revisions
1. One free minor tweak (see note [1]) is included.  
2. Further changes are billed at **\$40 / h** in 10-minute (1⁄6 h) increments.  
3. I will always state the estimated hours and await your approval before starting paid revisions.

### 5. Warranty & Bug-Fix Window
For **14 calendar days** after invoice payment I will correct, free of charge, any defect that prevents the script from meeting the approved spec.  
Platform/API changes are excluded (see § 6).

### 6. One-Off Maintenance
If the script stops working after the warranty window because the target platform or API has changed:
* A flat **\$25** covers up to ≈ 1 h of remedial work.  
* Extra time, if required, is billed at **\$40 / h**.

Each incident is quoted and invoiced after you approve the effort.

### 7. Payment Terms
1. **No deposit** is required.  
2. Payment is due on receipt; deliverables are released only after the invoice is settled.  
3. If you cancel before delivery I will invoice time spent to date at \$40 / h, capped at the original fixed price (time evidenced by timesheets / editor logs).  
4. PayPal processing fees are absorbed by me.

### 8. Intellectual Property
1. On full payment you receive exclusive ownership of the final script and may modify, distribute, or open-source it at will (attribution appreciated, not required).  
2. I retain the right to reuse generic, non-proprietary utility snippets in other projects.

### 9. Portfolio & Confidentiality
1. I may showcase a feature list or short demo video/GIF with all identifying details removed.  
2. Any credentials or personal data you supply are deleted within **30 days** of project completion, except for information legally required on invoices.  
3. I do not disclose private client data. You are free to publish or share the code.

### 10. Refusal & Acceptable Use
1. I reserve the right to refuse any commission.  
2. You are solely responsible for how the script is used, including any adult or NSFW context.

### 11. Liability
My total liability (contractual, tortious or otherwise) is limited to **the lesser of \$1 000 or the amount you actually paid** for the project. I accept no liability for indirect, special, or consequential losses.

### 12. Governing Law
This agreement is governed by the laws of **England & Wales** and subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.

### 13. Contact & Support
* **Discord:** `@PineaFan`  
* **E-mail:** `pineafan@companies.pinea.dev`
